    "In this Hurkle game environment, we implement a crucial constraint: the Hurkle can occupy only one square at a time. This **mutual exclusion principle** is encoded into our knowledge base (KB), significantly enhancing the inference system's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KB now contains not only the Hurkle's true location (e.g., `H21`) but also the logical implication that all other locations must be false. This is achieved through a **mutual exclusion clause** stating that if `H21` is true, then all other locations are false. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logical Symbols for Constraints**: We use logical symbols, specifically **conjunction** (AND, `&`) and **negation** (NOT, `~`), to enforce the rule that the Hurkle can occupy only one square at a time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Mutual Exclusion Clause**: This clause is constructed using negations to represent all locations other than the true Hurkle location. It effectively states that if the Hurkle is at one specific position, it cannot be at any other. This is expressed as:\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    " NOT location1 AND NOT location2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implication Rule**: Using the implication symbol (`==>`), we add a rule to the knowledge base that asserts that if the Hurkle is in its true location, it must not be in any other location.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, when we query the KB about any location (e.g., `H42`) using `ask_if_true()`, the system can accurately infer whether it is true or false. If `H21` is true, the KB can deduce that `H42` must be false, demonstrating the power of logical inference with properly defined constraints.\n",

    "#### Task 3: Implementing Directional Guidance in the Hurkle Game\n",
    "\n",
    "With the mutual exclusion constraint defined, the player can now receive directional hints towards the Hurkle based on their guess location. We use **eight directional symbols** (N, S, W, E, NE, SE, SW, NW), represented using `expr()` and stored in a list for efficient access.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the correct direction between the Hurkle's and player's locations, we implemented a `directions()` function. This function calculates the relative direction of the player's guess and then calls `tell_directions()`, a helper function that updates the knowledge base with the correct direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tell_directions()` function performs two key actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adding the Correct Direction**: It asserts the correct direction (e.g., SE) into the knowledge base.\n",
    "2. **Applying Mutual Exclusion**: It uses a logical clause to state that if one direction is true, all others must be false. This is achieved with logical **AND** (`&`) and **negation** (`~`) operators, similar to the approach used in the previous task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system relies on logical inference to update and confirm directional information. By calling `ask_if_true()`, we can query if a specific direction is correct based on the knowledge base’s state. For instance, if the Hurkle is at location 'H21' and the player's guess is at 'H42', the system determines that **Southeast (SE)** is the correct direction, marks SE as true, and negates all other directions. This ensures that when queried, only SE is confirmed as accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting the Hurkle's location and making a guess, we can view the updated knowledge base and check various directions using `ask_if_true()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is efficient and avoids the **\\(2^n\\)** combinatorial explosion common in exhaustive constraint systems. Instead of generating all combinations, this method directly asserts a single true direction and negates the rest, making the logic scalable. \n",
